### An Arduino-based Smart Home System for Efficient Climate Control and Security

![Smart Home Control](path_to_image.png)

This project involves an Arduino-based smart controller that detects human presence and measures ambient temperature to automatically adjust fan speed or AC temperature to optimal levels. Additionally, it functions as a home security system, detecting intruders and triggering alerts when necessary.

## 🌟 Features

1. **Human Presence Detection**: Automatically detects human presence in a room and adjusts the climate control system accordingly.
2. **Optimal Temperature Control**: Measures the ambient temperature to set the fan speed or AC temperature for comfortable living conditions.
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces energy consumption by adjusting fan or AC operation based on room occupancy and temperature.
4. **Home Intruder Detection**: Acts as a security system that detects unexpected movements or intrusions in the home and triggers alerts.
5. **Customizable Settings**: Allows for adjustment of sensitivity levels for human detection and temperature thresholds for climate control.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Arduino**: The core microcontroller that controls the sensors, fan, AC, and security system.
- **PIR Sensor**: Used to detect human presence by sensing motion in the room.
- **Temperature Sensor (DHT11/DHT22)**: Monitors ambient temperature to adjust the fan speed or AC settings.
- **Relay Modules**: Controls the switching of fans or AC based on sensor input.
- **Buzzer/Alarm**: Triggers an alert when an intruder is detected.
- **LCD Display**: Shows real-time temperature and fan/AC status.

## 📊 Usage

- **Climate Control**: Automatically adjusts the fan speed or AC temperature based on detected human presence and ambient temperature.
- **Security System**: Detects motion when no one is expected to be home, triggering an alarm to alert homeowners of a potential intruder.
